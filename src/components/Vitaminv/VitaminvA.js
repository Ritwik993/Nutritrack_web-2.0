          Though vitamin A deficiency is rare in developed countries such as the
          United States, it’s common in developing countries, where populations
          may have limited access to food sources of preformed vitamin A and
          provitamin A carotenoids.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vitamin A deficiency can lead to severe health complications.
          <br />
          <br />
          According to the World Health Organization, vitamin A deficiency is
          the leading cause of preventable blindness in children worldwide
          <br />
          <br />
          Vitamin A deficiency also increases the severity and risk of dying
          from infections like measles and diarrhea .<br />
          <br />
          Additionally, research has found that vitamin A deficiency raises the
          risk of anemia and death in pregnant women and negatively impacts the
          fetus by slowing growth and development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Less severe symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include skin issues such
          as hyperkeratosis and acne.
          <br />
          <br />
          Certain groups — such as premature infants, people with cystic
          fibrosis, and pregnant or breastfeeding people in developing countries
          — are more at risk of vitamin A deficiency <br />

          There are many dietary sources of both preformed vitamin A and
          provitamin A carotenoids.
          <br />
          <br />
          Preformed vitamin A is more readily absorbed and utilized by your body
          than plant-based sources of provitamin A carotenoids.
          <br />
          <br />
          Your body’s ability to effectively convert carotenoids, such as beta
          carotene, into active vitamin A depends on many factors — including
          genetics, diet, overall health, and medications
          <br />
          <br />
          For this reason, those who follow plant-based diets — especially
          vegans — should be vigilant about getting enough carotenoid-rich
          foods.
          <br />
          <br />
          Foods highest in preformed vitamin A include:
