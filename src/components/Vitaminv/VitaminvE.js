        <p className="vitaminE-deficiency-text-v">
          Vitamin E deficiency is rare but can lead to several health issues,
          including:
          <br />
          <br />
          - Muscle weakness: Vitamin E is essential for maintaining muscle
          health, and deficiency can lead to weakness and coordination problems.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Vision problems: Vitamin E is important for eye health, and
          deficiency may contribute to vision problems, such as retinal
          degeneration.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Impaired immune function: Vitamin E deficiency can weaken the immune
          system, making the body more susceptible to infections.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Nerve damage: Severe vitamin E deficiency can lead to nerve damage,
          which can cause pain, numbness, and muscle weakness.
        </p>

        <h1 className="heading-vitaminE-v">Benefits</h1>
        <p className="vitaminE-benefits-text-v">
          Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps protect cells from
          damage. It plays a crucial role in immune function, skin health, and
          vision.
          <br />
          <br />
          Vitamin E also has anti-inflammatory properties and may help protect
          against chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and cognitive
          decline.
